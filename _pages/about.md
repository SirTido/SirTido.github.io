About Me
======

Naturally curious and observant. Thrives on new challenges and never stops seeking out learning opportunities and sharing knowledge.

I enjoy solving problems with data, whether that is a personal problem, like creating [my own recommender model](https://github.com/maggiewolff/running_clothes_recommender) to figure out what to wear when running through another chilly Chicago winter, or on the job, using data to create better user experiences. Recently I looked at the impact of [user effort on business outcomes](https://github.com/maggiewolff/user-effort-index/blob/main/IDEAL%20-%20Maggie%20Wolff%20-%20User%20Effort.pdf). 

My current work typically includes advanced analysis, A/B (hypothesis) testing, predictive modeling, and defining new metrics. I also enjoy mentoring and [knowledge sharing](/talks/) with colleagues and others in the industry.

I pivoted to analytics in 2016, after working in marketing and communication roles (which included some data analysis) for a decade. I've always loved math and logic, and I draw on my previous experience when communicating the complex messages I find in data.

Currently working in the travel tech industry analyzing user experiences for a corporate travel booking platform. Holds an MS in Data Science. Ambassador for [Women in Data Science (WiDS)](http:/www.widsconference.org). Organizer for [MeasureCamp Chicago](https://chicago.measurecamp.org/). Also oversees a mentorship program via [Data Angels](http://dataangels.org/), a Slack community for women in data.
